A university project where there were a list of tasks to complete to pass it. I decided to take it a little bit further and make a videogame like Call of Duty Black Ops. The entire project is made in Unreal Engine 5 blueprints and you can try it out here: [The Undead Simulation](https://legiondecidard.itch.io/the-undead-simulation)
